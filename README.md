<h1>Hi, I'm Courtney!</h1>
<h2>I'm a Data Analyst with a passion for data driven problem solving and extracting insights from data to drive growth. When I'm not working on data analytic projects, I enjoy traveling, working on puzzles, reading, and learning new skills. I'm also involved in dog sports - partnering with my corgi, Cheddar, in agility. She's much better at it than I am!

This is my portfolio of personal data projects - I'll be adding to it as I create and explore. I'd love to connect with others who share a passion for using data to make positive impacts in our communities.</h2>
